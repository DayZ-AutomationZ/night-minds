# Night Minds – Chronotype Awareness

This is a one-page awareness project about delayed circadian rhythms and chronotypes.

I made this because I ran into this problem myself — not once, but my whole life.  
Being productive at night and needing daytime rest is constantly mistaken for laziness, lack of discipline, or motivation. It isn’t.

Some brains peak late. That’s biology, not character.

This page exists to explain that clearly, calmly, and without excuses — especially for kids who are still developing and get punished for a rhythm they didn’t choose.

The goal is simple:
- stop shaming biology  
- start adapting systems  
- prevent unnecessary stress, burnout, and lost potential  

This page is meant to stay online, be shared quietly, and be found by people who recognize themselves in it.
